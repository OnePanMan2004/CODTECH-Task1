## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT: 
QUIZ GAME

### OBJECTIVE: 
Developing a simple and engaging quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. The game should accurately track the user's score and provide immediate feedback based on their answers. This game aims to enhance the user's knowledge through an interactive learning experience, ensuring a user-friendly interface and a rewarding feedback mechanism to maintain user interest and engagement.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1. C Programming Language: The entire quiz game is written in C, a general-purpose programming language.

2. Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h): This library is used for input and output functions, such as printf and scanf, which handle displaying questions and receiving user input.

3. Standard Library (stdlib.h): This library is included for general-purpose functions, such as memory allocation and conversion functions. However, in this particular code, it is not explicitly used.

4. String Handling Library (string.h): This library is used for handling strings. In this code, it is included to support operations on strings, although specific string manipulation functions are not used directly in the provided code.
